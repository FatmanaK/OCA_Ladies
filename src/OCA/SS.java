     * 98. Which three are advantages of the Java exception mechanism? (Choose three.)
     * Improves the program structure because the error handling code is separated from the normal program
     * function
     * Provides a set of standard exceptions that covers all possible errors
     * Improves the program structure because the programmer can choose where to handle exceptions D. Improves the program structure because exceptions must be handled in the method in which they occurred
     * E. Allows the creation of new exceptions that are customized to the particular program being created

     * 133. Which statement is true about Java byte code?
     *  A. It can run on any platform.
     * It can run on any platform only if it was compiled for that platform.
     * It can run on any platform that has the Java Runtime Environment.
     * It can run on any platform that has a Java compiler.
     * It can run on any platform only if that platform has both the Java Runtime Environment and a Java
     * compiler.
     * Answer: C  cikti
     * Explanation:
     * Java bytecodes help make "write once, run anywhere" possible. You can compile your program into bytecodes on any platform that has a Java compiler. The bytecodes can then be run on any implementation of the Java VM. That means that as long as a computer has a Java VM, the same program written in the Java programming language can run on Windows 2000, a Solaris workstation, or on an iMac.
     * 134. Which is true about the switch statement?

     * The break statement, at the end of each case block, is optional.
     * Its case label literals can be changed at runtime.
     * It must contain the default section.

     * All subclasses of the RuntimeException class are not recoverable.
     * The parameter in a catch block is of Throwable type.
     * All subclasses of the RuntimeException class must be caught or declared to be thrown.
     * All subclasses of the RuntimeException class are unchecked exceptions.
